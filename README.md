## final thoughts:
I took a lot of time to plan and pseudocode this project, so I found actually coding it fairly simple. I still had some issues with what methods and syntax to use with JavaScript versus jQuery selectors, but I am getting better.

There are a couple of extra things I'd like to fix here once I get a chance:
1. Display an error message when the user's search returns an error.
2. Really polish the design:
  - Fix text wrapping for the small forecast cards.
  - Fix text alignment and spacing so it makes more sense on smaller screens.
